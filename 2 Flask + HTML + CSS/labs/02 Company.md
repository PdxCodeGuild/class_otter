Pick an industry and create the landing page for a hypothetical company, filling in as much detail as possible. Use media queries and CSS flexbox to create a responsive design that offers different, legible layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. You can test this in the broswer devtools. Don't forget to use cascading min-width media queries for a mobile first design, and remember to include the responsive meta tag in your HTML. Browse the internet for existing company pages and imitate as much as you can.

## Suggested Steps:

1. Create the HTML structure for your blog, with all content included.
2. Create your mobile version, using the styling of your choice.
3. Use ```min-width``` media queries to add a tablet layout using flexbox. Customize your styling as needed. You probably want your breakpoint between phone and tablet widths to be somewhere around 640-768px.
4. Finally, add your desktop layout. Customize styling as needed. A good breakpoint for desktop screen sizes is around 960-1100px.
