          <p>A credit repair company is an organization that can help
               you understand and repair your credit by analyzing your
                credit report and disputing inaccuracies with credit bureaus
                 and creditors. Credit repair companies have the experience 
                 and knowledge to tackle credit issues that could be difficult
                  to resolve on your own.</p>

            <p2>The first is that if the information the credit repair service 
                is disputing is indeed correct, they will re-report it the next 
                time they submit data to the bureaus. Also, deliberately disputing
                 accurate notations is an illegal misuse of the process.</p2>
