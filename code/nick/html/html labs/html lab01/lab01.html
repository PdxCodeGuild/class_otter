    <p>
      Lonnie George Johnson (born October 6, 1949) is an American inventor,
      aerospace engineer, and entrepreneur, whose work includes a U.S. Air
      Force-term of service and a twelve-year stint at NASA, where he worked at
      the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He invented the Super Soaker water gun in
      1989, which has been among the world's bestselling toys ever since. He

      Nobody's going to step in and dump a lot of money and make it easy. Unless
      you have a lot of money, you have to pay your dues and make a personal
      sacrifice.
