1. Wanted to use some CLI module.
2. Click was mentioned so I checked it out.
3. It does several things.
    a. Eliminates need to type 'python file.py.
    b. Add decorators so functions can be called with options
    c. Provides a way to pass objects between functions in a module.
    d. Provides framework so I just add to each function:
        1. option
        2. help text
        3. prompt text
        4. type
        5. default values
4. Used setuptools-setup to build the package and set up entry points
    a. Entry points are the commands used to run the functions.
    b. The use of entry points allows use of options.
