Using 'pipenv install --editable .' DOES NOT add dependency 'click' (in setup.py) to Pipfile. Click is installed but not added to Pipfile.
Using 'pipenv install click' DOES add 'click' to Pipfile.

# No packages in Pipfile, 'click' and 'hello-click' not installed yet:
    # Install the hello-click package.
    pipenv install --editable .
    # 'click' and 'hello-click' now installed.
    # Pipfile packages only lists 'hello-click'.
# Need to install click separately to have it added to Pipfile.
    pipenv install click
