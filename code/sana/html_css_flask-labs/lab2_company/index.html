    <h3>Why The NPC’s Need To Grow </h3>
    <p>Some top level VA managers may view the NPCs as risky and small in the context of VA’s $168.8 billion budget. Many of the NPCs are well-heeled, but many are struggling.</p>
    <p>Some NPCs are undercapitalized because they have relied too much on the lean overheads allowed by Federal funders. Retention of key NPC personnel depends largely upon organizational resources and prospects for growth</p>
    <h3>VA NPCs</h3>
    <p>OIG Report No. 07-00564-121 dated May 5, 2008 Recommendation  No. 4</p>
    <q>“We recommended that the Under Secretary for Health develop and implement oversight procedures to perform substantive reviews of NPC financial and management controls to ensure NPCs fully comply with Federal laws, VHA policies, and control standards.”</q>
    <p>The more revenues and resources the NPCs can muster, the better able they will be to support VA research and education while also developing their own organizations.</p>
