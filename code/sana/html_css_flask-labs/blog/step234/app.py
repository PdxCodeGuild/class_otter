Through this program, NAVREF supports the cost of sending two or three specifically selected, experienced executie directors or NAVREF staff members to spend two days on-site reviewing all aspects of the NPC's management. Bi-Monthly Newsletter - NAVREF sends news items relevant to NPCs to NPC executive directors. These items are posted on the NAVREF website for NAVREF member access.
    SCRS Membership - NAVREF membership comes with SCRS membership too! SCRS offers several monthly webinar series on topics of interest to research sites."""

         Funding Resources - NAVREF offers members the unique benefit to work with a single point of contact that connects industry opportunities with VA resources.
    Advocacy - NAVREF is an active participant in advocacy efforts to secure robust funding for VA research and development. This entails lobbying for an increase in the annual appropriation for the VA medical and prosthetic research account, which is separate from VA health care appropriation. NAVREF works with House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees to highlight research and education issues pertinent to VA.
    Affinity Program - With multiple partners, NAVREF members can enjoy the benefit of using our collective strength to access competitive insurance, retirement, human resource, and procurement plans."""

Grants from the American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, and many others continue to be very important to the NPCs and should not be overlooked

Federal funds administration, NIH, DOD, CDMRP, is presently our largest source of revenues at 69% and growing

65 of the 84 NPCs administer some Federal funds

NIH and DoD budgets are not growing much

Federal grants are increasingly competitive

Only about 10 percent of NIH grant proposals are awarded

Federal grants require careful, costly administration

Federal funders allow very lean overheads for administration

Some NPCs have eroded their capital because they have relied too heavily on Federal funds administration

A few affiliated universities insist on managing all NIH awards

CDMRP (DoD) is an especially good opportunity for us
