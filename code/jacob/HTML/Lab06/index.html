            <p>My name is Jacob McElhaney, I'm a Junior Frontend Developer working remotely in Seattle, Wa.
                  For the last 15 years I worked in Retail Management. I wanted a change of scenery and started learning 
                  web development. I quickly found a thourough enjoyment in developing web applications. 

                  I enjoy challenges and learning new to overcome those challenges to better prepare for the next.
                  All of my life I have worked with varying groups of individuals to accomplish our goals and love
                  the aspect of a career doing that in the Web development profession.
            </p>

            <p>I have developed a great understanding of Python, HTML and CSS. I love to use the skills I now have
                to work through challenging problems and designs to see those creations come to life. It has been thrilling
                to create programs and websites that show off my understanding of these languages. I look forward to the next
                adventure that awaits working in this profession.
