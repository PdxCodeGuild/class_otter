        <h1>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</h1>
        <h2>January 3rd, 1892 - September 2, 1973</h2>

        <p class="p1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>
            was and English writer, poet, philologist and academic best known as the
            author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>.
            He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke
            College, Oxford from 1925 to 1945 and the Merton Professor of English Language and
            Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1959. He was a close friend
            of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings.
            Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II
            on 28 March 1972. After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works
            based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a>.
            These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales,
            poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world
            called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth.[b] Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term
            legendarium to the larger part of these writings. While many other authors had published
            works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
            led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly
            identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literatureâ€”or, more precisely, of high fantasy.</p>

        <p class="p3">"Children aren't a class. They are merely human beings at different stages
            of maturity. All of them have a human intelligence which even at its lowest
            is a pretty wonderfull thing, and the entire world in front of them."
