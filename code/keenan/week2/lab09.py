# Lab 9: Compute Automated Readability Index
# 01/13/2022

# Description:
# Compute the ARI for a given body of text loaded in from a file. The automated readability index 
# (ARI) is a formula for computing the U.S. grade level for a given block of text. The general formula to compute the ARI is as follows:

# 4.71(characters / words) + 0.5(words/sentences) -21.43

# The score is computed by multiplying the number of characters divided by the number of words by 4.71, adding the number of words divided 
# by the number of sentences multiplied by 0.5, and subtracting 21.43. If the result is a decimal, always round up. Scores greater than 14 
# should be presented as having the same age and grade level as scores of 14.

# Scores correspond to the following ages and grad levels:

#     Score  Ages     Grade Level
#      1       5-6    Kindergarten
#      2       6-7    First Grade
#      3       7-8    Second Grade
#      4       8-9    Third Grade
#      5      9-10    Fourth Grade
#      6     10-11    Fifth Grade
#      7     11-12    Sixth Grade
#      8     12-13    Seventh Grade
#      9     13-14    Eighth Grade
#     10     14-15    Ninth Grade
#     11     15-16    Tenth Grade
#     12     16-17    Eleventh grade
#     13     17-18    Twelfth grade
#     14     18-22    College
# Once youâ€™ve computed the ARI score, you can use the ari_scale dictionary below to look up the age range and grade level.


# The output should look something like the following:
# --------------------------------------------------------

# The ARI for gettysburg-address.txt is 12
# This corresponds to a 11th Grade level of difficulty
# that is suitable for an average person 16-17 years old.

# --------------------------------------------------------

# need to import the regular expressions module and the ceil() function from the math module for rounding up
