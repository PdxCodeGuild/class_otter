Capstone Proposal


NAME: YGT(You Got This!) - Home Workout Random Generator W/ Timer

PROJECT OVERVIEW: Anywhere, Anytime YGT provides you random functional fitness workouts without any equipment

FEATURES:
	1. As a traveler, I want to have an automatic circuit training timer for workout and rest between workouts, because I don’t have a timer with me all the time.
	2. As a home training lover, I want to edit the list of workouts so I can do other workouts too. 
	3. As a student, I want to get fit and healthy without using any expensive equipment or gear, because I’m on a budget.
	4. As a fitness trainer, I want a workout tracker for members because I want to be able to track my members’ progress

	-TASKS:
		1. Allow to customize(add, delete) the workout list
		2. Make a workout timer(Total time = workouts + rests)
			ex) Total time - 20, 30, 45 minutes
				 Workouts - 20, 45 seconds 
				  Rests - 10, 15 seconds
		3. Each user needs a workout tracker (calendar) to mark down the day that the user did workout 

DATA MODEL: User, Workout List, Calendar, etc.

	week 1[1~5]: Focus on building an interval timer(workout & rest) for the user with customizable features
	week 1[6~7]: User Registration and login authentication
	week 2: Make the workout tracker (calendar)
	week 3: CSS and add more workouts into the workout list
