                     Alignment

We have easy to use classes to help you align your content.

                     Vertical Align

You can easily vertically center things by adding the 
class valign-wrapper to the container holding the items 
you want to vertically align.

<div class="valign-wrapper">
  <h5 class="valign">This should be vertically aligned</h5>
</div>



                        Text Align

These classes are for horizontally aligning content. 
We have .left-align, .right-align and .center-align


This should be left aligned


                               This should be right aligned


                This should be center aligned

  <div>
    <h5 class="left-align">This should be left aligned</h5>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 class="right-align">This should be right aligned</h5>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 class="center-align">This should be center aligned</h5>
  </div>
        

Quick Floats
Quickly float things by adding the class left or right to the element. !important is used to avoid specificity issues.


<div class="left">...</div>
<div class="right">...</div>
        

                        Hiding Content

                      Formatting

These classes help format various content on your site.

Truncation

To truncate long lines of text in an ellipsis, add the 
class truncate to the tag which contains the text. 
See an example below of a header being truncated inside 
a card.

This is an extremel....     y long title that will be truncated

  <h4 class="truncate">This is an extremely long title that will be truncated</h4>
        

Hover

The hoverable is a hover class that adds an animation for 
box shadow as seen below. It can be used on most elements,
 but meant for use on cards.
