        <h2>Who Is Warren Buffett?</h2>
        <p>Warren Buffett demonstrated keen business abilities at a young age.<br> He formed Buffett Partnership Ltd. in 1956, and by 1965 he had assumed control of Berkshire Hathaway. Overseeing the growth of a conglomerate with holdings in the media, insurance, energy and food and beverage industries, Buffett became one of the world's richest men and a celebrated philanthropist.</p>  
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p> Warren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska.<br>
            Buffett's father, Howard, worked as a stockbroker and served as a U.S. congressman.<br>
            His mother, Leila Stahl Buffett, was a homemaker.<br> Buffett was the second of three children and the only boy.<br>
            He demonstrated a knack for financial and business matters early in his childhood: Friends and acquaintances have said the young boy was a mathematical prodigy who could add large columns of numbers in his head, a talent he occasionally demonstrated in his later years.<br>
            Buffett often visited his father's stock brokerage shop as a child and chalked in the stock prices on the blackboard in the office.<br>
            At 11 years old he made his first investment, buying three shares of Cities Service Preferred at $38 per share.<br>
            The stock quickly dropped to only $27, but Buffett held on tenaciously until it reached $40.<br>
            He sold his shares at a small profit but regretted the decision when Cities Service shot up to nearly $200 a share.<br>
            He later cited this experience as an early lesson in patience in investing.</p>
