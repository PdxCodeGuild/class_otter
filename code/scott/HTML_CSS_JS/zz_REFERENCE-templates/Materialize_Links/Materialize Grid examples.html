<!--Grid
    We are using a standard 12 column fluid responsive grid system. 
    The grid helps you layout your page in an ordered, easy fashion.

    Container
    The container class is not strictly part of the grid but is important 
    in laying out content. It allows you to center your page content. 
    The container class is set to ~70% of the window width. It helps you 
    center and contain your page content. We use the container to contain 
    our body content.

    To add a container just put your content inside a <div> tag with a 
    container class. Here's an example of how your page might be set up.

    <body>
      <div class="container">
        #Page Content goes here# 
        </div>
    </body>

    12 Columns
    Our standard grid has 12 columns. No matter the size of the browser, each of these columns 
    will always have an equal width.

    1----2----3----4----5----6----7----8----9----10----11----12

<div class="row">
      <div class="col s1">1</div>
      <div class="col s1">2</div>
      <div class="col s1">3</div>
      <div class="col s1">4</div>
      <div class="col s1">5</div>
      <div class="col s1">6</div>
      <div class="col s1">7</div>
      <div class="col s1">8</div>
      <div class="col s1">9</div>
      <div class="col s1">10</div>
      <div class="col s1">11</div>
      <div class="col s1">12</div>
    </div>

    Note: For now, just know that the s1 stands for small-1 
    which in plain English means "1 column on small screens".

        Columns live inside Rows

    Remember when you are creating your layout that all columns must be 
    contained inside a row and that you must add the col class to your 
    inner divs to make them into columns.

            This div is 12-columns wide on all screen sizes
    6-columns (one-half)                            6-columns (one-half)

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12">This div is 12-columns wide</div>
      <div class="col s6">This div is 6-columns wide</div>
      <div class="col s6">This div is 6-columns wide</div>
    </div>
          

    Offsets
    To offset, simply add offset-s2 to the class where s signifies 
    the screen class-prefix (s = small, m = medium, l = large) and 
    the number after is the number of columns you want to offset by.

    This div is 12-columns wide on all screen sizes6-columns 
    (offset-by-6)

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12"><span class="flow-text">This div is 
        12-columns wide on all screen sizes</span></div>
      <div class="col s6 offset-s6"><span class="flow-text">6-columns 
        (offset-by-6)</span></div>
    </div>
          

    Push and Pull
    You can easily change the order of your columns with push and pull. 
    Simply add push-s2 or pull-s2 to the class where s signifies the 
    screen class-prefix (s = small, m = medium, l = large) and the 
    number after is the number of columns you want to push or pull by.

    This div is 7-columns wide on pushed to the right by 
    5-columns.5-columns wide pulled to the left by 7-columns.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s7 push-s5"><span class="flow-text">This div is 
        7-columns wide on pushed to the right by 5-columns.</span></div>
      <div class="col s5 pull-s7"><span class="flow-text">5-columns wide 
        pulled to the left by 7-columns.</span></div>
    </div>
          

    Creating Layouts
    Here we will show you how to create some commonly used layouts with 
    our grid system. 
    Hopefully these will get you more comfortable with laying out 
    elements. To keep these demos simple, the ones here will not be
     responsive.

    Section:

    The section class is used for simple top and bottom padding. Just
     add the section class to your div's containing large blocks of 
     content.

    Divider:

    Dividers are 1 pixel lines that help break up your content. Just 
    add the divider to a div in between your content.

    Example Sections and Dividers
    Section 1
    Stuff

    Section 2
    Stuff

    Section 3
    Stuff


    <div class="divider"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>Section 1</h5>
        <p>Stuff</p>
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>Section 2</h5>
        <p>Stuff</p>
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>Section 3</h5>
        <p>Stuff</p>
    </div>
            

    Example Promotion Table
    If we want 3 divs that are equal size, we define the divs with a 
    width of 4-columns, 4+4+4 = 12, which nicely adds up to 12. Inside 
    those divs, we can put our content. Take our front page content for 
    example. We've modified it slightly for the sake of this example.

    We did most of the heavy lifting for you to provide a default 
    stylings that incorporate our custom components.

    User Experience Focused

    By utilizing elements and principles of Material Design, we were 
    able to create a framework that focuses on User Experience.

    We have provided detailed documentation as well as specific code 
    examples to help new users get started.


    <div class="row">

      <div class="col s4">
        <!-- Promo Content 1 goes here -->
    </div>
    <div class="col s4">
      <!-- Promo Content 2 goes here -->
    </div>
    <div class="col s4">
      <!-- Promo Content 3 goes here -->
    </div>

  </div>
        

    Example Side Navigation Layout

You can see how easy it is to create layouts using the grid system. 
Just remember to make sure your column numbers add up to 12 for an 
even layout.



  <!-- Navbar goes here -->

  <!-- Page Layout here -->
  <div class="row">

    <div class="col s3">
      <!-- Grey navigation panel -->
    </div>

    <div class="col s9">
      <!-- Teal page content  -->
    </div>

  </div>
        
        Creating Responsive Layouts

Above we showed you how to layout elements using our grid system. 
Now we'll show you how to design your layouts so that they look 
great on all screen sizes.

Screen Sizes
                Mobile Devices    Tablet Devices    Desktop Devices
                 <= 600px            <= 992px	       > 992px
Class Prefix	    .s	                .m	             .l
Container Width	     85%                85%              70%
Number of Columns	 12	                 12              12


                    Adding Responsiveness


In the previous examples, we only defined the size for small screens 
using "col s12". This is fine if we want a fixed layout since the 
rules propagate upwards. By just saying s12, we are essentially 
saying "col s12 m12 l12". But by explicitly defining the size we 
can make our website more responsive.

                               I am always full-width (col s12)
I am full-width on mobile (col s12 m6)

  <div class="row">
    <div class="grid-example col s12"><span class="flow-text">I am 
      always full-width (col s12)</span></div>
    <div class="grid-example col s12 m6"><span class="flow-text">I am 
      full-width on mobile (col s12 m6)</span></div>
  </div>
        

                Responsive Side Navigation Layout
                
In this example below, we take the same layout from above, 
but we make it responsive by defining how many columns the 
div should take up on each screen size. Try resizing your 
browser and watch the layout change below.



  <!-- Navbar goes here -->

  <!-- Page Layout here -->
  <div class="row">

    <div class="col s12 m4 l3"> <!-- Note that "m4 l3" was added -->
      <!-- Grey navigation panel

            This content will be:
        3-columns-wide on large screens,
        4-columns-wide on medium screens,
        12-columns-wide on small screens  -->

    </div>

    <div class="col s12 m8 l9"> <!-- Note that "m8 l9" was added -->
      <!-- Teal page content

            This content will be:
        9-columns-wide on large screens,
        8-columns-wide on medium screens,
        12-columns-wide on small screens  -->

    </div>

  </div>
