    <img src="Ada Lovelace.jpg" alt="Ada Lovelace" class="center"><br>
    <p id="page0">An English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's<br> 
        proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.<br>
        She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation,<br>
        and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.<br>
        As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
