    <p><b><font color=Blue>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace</b></font>(n√©e Byron; 10 December 1815 to 27 November 1852) <br>
        was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's <br>
        proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. <br>
        She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, <br>
        and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. <br>
        As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.</p>
