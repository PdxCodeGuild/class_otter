Lab 2: Company Home
Pick an industry and create the landing page for a hypothetical company, filling in as much detail as possible. Use media queries and
CSS flexbox to create a responsive design that offers different, legible layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. You can
test this in the broswer devtools. Don't forget to use cascading min-width media queries for a mobile first design, and remember to
include the responsive meta tag in your HTML. Browse the internet for existing company pages and imitate as much as you can.

Suggested Steps:
    Create the HTML structure for your blog, with all content included.
    Create your mobile version, using the styling of your choice.
    Use min-width media queries to add a tablet layout using flexbox. Customize your styling as needed. You probably want your breakpoint
between phone and tablet widths to be somewhere around 640-768px.
    Finally, add your desktop layout. Customize styling as needed. A good breakpoint for desktop screen sizes is around 960-1100px.
