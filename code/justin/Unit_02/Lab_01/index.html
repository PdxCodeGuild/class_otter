                        <p>Valerie Thomas is a former NASA project manager, scientest, inventor, and notable educational speaker. She made several contributions and led multiple projects during her decades working at NASA. In particular her creation of the Landsat program, as well as multiple media formats used in the program, are noteworthy. In 1980, she was granted the patent for her creation of the Illusion Transmitter -- a device used to project a 3d 'hologram' from a single image -- which is has been further adapted and is still in use by NASA today. Despite her various contributions to science, she has dedicated much of her time to speaking to students and future scientists at schools and conferences over the years.</p>

                            <q cite="https://citatis.com/a22092/36d7bf/">Sometimes having no script, having no idea what is going to happen next, having no map, might be the way to go. Because life just happens, and when it does, how you handle it will teach you more about who you are than any class or test ever can. The best preparation for the rest of your life is, maybe, no preparation at all. Dive right in. Make mistakes. Break a few rules. Wing it.</q>
