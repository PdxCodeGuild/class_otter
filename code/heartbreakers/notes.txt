Version 1
The goal is to calculate how many years it will take for two jackalopes to create a population of 1000.

    Jackalopes are reproductive from ages 4-8 and die at age 10.
    Gestation is instantaneous. Each gestation produces two offspring.
    Jackalopes are hermaphrodites, it takes a pair to reproduce, but any pair will do
    With these conditions in mind, we can represent our population as a list of ints.


year_counter = 0

while sum(population) < 1000:
    year_counter += 1

    # increment population age groups
    # calculate population in reproductive range
    # if mating_count > 0:
        # if odd, remove 1
        # make babies; update population count







track each jackalopes age
population = [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
